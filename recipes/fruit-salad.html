    <p>
        This fruit salad is perfect for a backyard bbq or any occasion. There are never leftovers! 
        <br>This is one of my favorite fruit salad recipes, as I think the citrusy sauce really makes it. 
        <br>This salad is tastier the longer you can let it soak in its juices. 
        <br>I prefer 3 to 4 hours in the refrigerator before I serve it.

        This fruit salad recipe is bright, colorful, and incredibly delicious.
