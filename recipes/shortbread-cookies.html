        Shortbread cookies originated in Scotland and are traditionally made with butter, sugar, and flour. 
        <br>Unlike other cookies, shortbread cookies don't have any leavening agents (like baking powder or baking soda). 
        <br>Because of this (plus the high fat content) shortbread cookies are incredibly tender and crumbly â€” 
        a good shortbread cookie will almost melt in your mouth.

    <p>
        This four-ingredient shortbread cookie recipe is about as easy as it gets.
